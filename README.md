This personal portfolio highlights my skills, experience, and projects, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern, responsive design with smooth scrolling, dynamic typing effects, and interactive elements like a sticky navbar, contact form with validation, and a scroll-up button for seamless navigation. The portfolio is optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. The tech stack includes HTML for structure, CSS for custom styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. It also utilizes libraries such as Typed.js for animated text, Font Awesome for icons, and Owl Carousel for interactive carousels. To get started, clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Customization is easyâ€”just update text, images, and form handling as needed. For inquiries, you can contact me via the form or at sreevarun@gmail.com.
